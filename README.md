# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The objective of this project is to develop a credit card fraud detection system using the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains a large number of credit card transactions, with both fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions to help financial institutions mitigate the risk and minimize losses due to fraudulent activities.
